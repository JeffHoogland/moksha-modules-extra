Emprint
---------------------------------------------------------
Emprint is a utility for taking screenshots of the entire screen, a specific
window, or a specific region. It is written with the Enlightenment Foundation
Libraries (http://www.enlightnement.org). It depends on a large number of
libraries that are only available in CVS at the moment.
