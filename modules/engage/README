Engage Module 


Engage will hold all of your open applications for fast switching and
is also an apllication launcher.

There are three basic functionalities that you dont want to miss:
1. If you click on an icon the corresponding  will be shown and
   raised to the top and if its on another desk, then you will 
   be switched right to it. 
2. If you drag an icon out of NG the App will be shown on the
   current desktop.
3. Drag an icon to a pagers desk to send it there.


lots of other stuff that you have to find out yourself for now :)
