This is a global todo list since it covers several or potentially all modules

Several of these modules throw a lintian image-file-in-usr-lib warning.

This is because they install one or more image files within /usr/lib.
specifically, at that module install location. But according to the
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, architecture-independent files should be
placed within /usr/share instead. Ideally, we should also change the code and the
meson.build to that. Perhaps each module could have a folder at
/usr/share/enlightenment/data/modules/
or whatever ...

Currently these are the modules with this issue
	moksha-module-snow:   image-file-in-usr-lib
	moksha-module-news:   image-file-in-usr-lib
	moksha-module-rain:   image-file-in-usr-lib
	moksha-module-photo:  image-file-in-usr-lib
	moksha-module-engage: image-file-in-usr-lib
