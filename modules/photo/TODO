BUGS
----------------------------------------------------

* sometimes the histo menu seems not to show the popup info

----------------------------------------------------
Bodhi Wanted
----------------------------------------------------

* Use of 4096 in buffers esp in photo_picture_infos_get where in extreme
  and unusual cases it would cause the output string to be truncated.
  Perhaps shorten long paths somehow before display.
  
* Wondering what picture net was about. net struct was removed from 
  Photo_Config but we still have two useless phot0_net files. Maybe variety
  could be an inspiration here.
  
* Totaly unsure about the BUG listed above ?

* Perhaps use notifcations for some of the 'dialogs'

* Add support for import Settings dialog from e

* add config options for fill center et al for background

* case file is edj in photo_item_action_setbg needs fixed or removed
  Can this case ever happen?

----------------------------------------------------
NEEDED
----------------------------------------------------

* fix the "Set as wallpaper", using E code, like slideshow module

* option to set the thumb size, and no thumb mode

* find a way to have the path of a generated thumb, to load it direcly
  instead of always using e_thumb (delay)
  the other solution would be a cache, and its not a good one =)

* add some borders between different item categories
  in config panels
* change item action setbg with
  e patch edj_gen to e_utils
* border around the pictures
  need to create an object that will contain my edje object
  so the object with the theme is able to be an oblong
* ability to add a dir without reloading all
* rethink local load idler to be less heavy

----------------------------------------------------
FUTURE
----------------------------------------------------

* picture net (get from devian's TODO)
