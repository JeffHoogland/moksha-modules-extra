First in the config dialog you have two options: 
	(i) Be so smart as win_must_die does, and 
	(ii) be suitable for advanced users like everybody on this list. 

If the first option is selected, then each scrapshot is saved in /tmp, 
or ~/tmp and the preview box is displayed with a thumbanailed scrapshot image, 
and two buttons "Close" and "Save As....". 

In the Advanced case, i'd leave the behaviour of the ss as is.

* Nice to have *

* The ss module should highlight when mouse overs it. Similarly as Start module does.
  Because now, it is not clear if the user can press on it and expect some actions.
